It is created in python language using Inkscaper. An education in software for all ages. 

Some Quartets arenâ€™t complete yet. Keep your folder updated and print the missing cards as soon as possible. This Card game keeps on growing!

- Goal

 This way we highlight that the information is created with open source and we share this information by making cards you can collect physically. Quartet is used to playfully educate all ages. We want to design this quartet to get more familair with free software. 
 The collected quartet will show an overview of what is there to use on the web.

- HOW TO: RUN THE CHATBOT

To run the quartet, you need to go into the folder 'quartet proposal', then give the command: pyhton3, then import os, and then you need to run inkscaper: %run inkscaper.py

And select the files that you need to run; 

Inkscaper.py
all_reviews.py
test.svg

This will make sure that all the .svg files will be written. After writing all the files you can find in the folder .svg all the new templates. 

What the code also does is writing a file with all the cards one and afther each other. 


- HOW TO PRINT THE CARDDECK

To print the complete card deck, you need to open the card deck file wich is created inside of the folder. Then you have to adjust the settings to four cards on one a4 paper. And then you need to print that side first, and then you need to to do the other side, with the background.
With printing, use the coated side up.

For printing use astraluxe 250 grams, one side coated.
